# Tsugi: Welcome to My videos

A page to introduce my videos to all course sites and help with DIY recordings.

To execute scripts add the following to visudo:
```
wwwrun ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/scripts/tsugi/tsugi-my-videos-setup.pl
```

Requires the scripts to be set in visudo and the tmp folder to have wwwrun ownership.
